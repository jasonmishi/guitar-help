# Guitar George
A webapp made to help you learn chord structures on the guitar. Currently based around the "Essentail Chords" of Ted Greene's book "Chord Chemistry".
This tool was made to help with chord memorization The circular notes on the fretboard are the main notes and the rest are optional notes. The notes on top are randomized notes and the numbers below are randomized strings. The idea is to try to play the chord with the root note on the string from memory. Clicking on the string will then reveal the chords and you can check to see if you got them all. Currently only major chords are present.
